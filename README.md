# timed-survey
## The project
### Create a timed survey that reduces available time with incorrect answers and keeps the score of each attempt.
-Create an HTML that is accessed in the JavaScript.
-DOM elements are dynamically created and replaced as the user clicks on buttons that call functions in the JavaScript file.
-The first function to be called is a setInterval that begins at 75 seconds and counts down to zero.
-The second function replaces the opening page HTML with the question and possible answers.
